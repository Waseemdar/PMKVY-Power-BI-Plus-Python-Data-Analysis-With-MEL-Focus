        "\n",
        "The coefficient of variation (CV) highlights substantial regional differences in the stability of placement outcomes under PMKVY.\n",
        "\n",
        "The West region shows the highest volatility in placement outcomes (CV ≈ 0.51), despite a relatively low mean placement rate. This indicates highly inconsistent employment outcomes across states within the region.\n",
        "\n",
        "The North East also exhibits very high volatility (CV ≈ 0.46), suggesting uneven labor absorption capacity and fragile market linkages.\n",
        "\n",
        "The South, while having a comparatively higher average placement rate, still shows moderate volatility (CV ≈ 0.40), implying that strong outcomes are not uniformly distributed across states.\n",
        "\n",
        "The East and North regions demonstrate lower volatility (CV ≈ 0.34 and 0.32, respectively), indicating relatively more predictable placement outcomes, even if average performance differs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, regions with higher average placement rates do not necessarily exhibit lower volatility, reinforcing that average performance and stability are distinct dimensions of program success.\n",
        "\n",
        "🎯 Key Analytical Insight\n",
        "\n",
        "Placement outcomes under PMKVY are not uniformly unstable nationwide.\n",
        "Instead, volatility is region-specific, reflecting differences in:\n",
        "\n",
        "Regional labor market structure\n",
        "\n",
        "Industry concentration and demand\n",
        "\n",
        "Migration patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "Effectiveness of state-level placement and employer engagement mechanisms\n",
        "\n",
        "This confirms that placement performance is shaped more by regional market dynamics than by training system quality alone.\n",

        "🏛️ Monitoring & Program Implications\n",
        "1. Avoid Uniform National Placement Benchmarks\n",
        "\n",
        "High regional volatility implies that national averages mask meaningful regional risks. Placement targets should be region-adjusted, not centrally imposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Treat High-Volatility Regions as “Risk Zones”\n",
        "\n",
        "Regions such as the West and North East should be flagged for:\n",
        "\n",

        "Strengthened employer partnerships\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved post-certification support mechanisms\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Use Stability as a Monitoring Signal\n",
        "\n",
        "Regions with lower CVs (North, East) demonstrate more predictable outcomes and can serve as operational benchmarks, even if their mean placement rates are moderate.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Separate Performance from Predictability\n",
        "\n",
        "Monitoring frameworks should track:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean placement rate (how good outcomes are)\n",
        "\n",
        "Coefficient of variation (how reliable outcomes are)\n",
        "\n",
        "Both dimensions are necessary for evidence-based decision-making.\n",

        "🧠 Strategic Takeaway (one line)\n",
        "\n",
        "Placement under PMKVY is not just uneven—it is regionally unstable, and volatility itself is a critical signal for where monitoring and intervention should be prioritized."

        "\n",
        "This indicates that placement outcomes across training types are nearly four times more volatile than certification outcomes.\n",

        "In contrast, certification performance is relatively stable across training categories, suggesting that training delivery and assessment processes are broadly standardized regardless of training type.\n",

        "\n",
        "Low CSR volatility (CV = 0.23) implies that most training types achieve comparable certification outcomes once candidates reach the assessment stage.\n",

        "Very high placement volatility (CV = 0.87) shows that employability varies dramatically by training type, reflecting differences in:\n",

        "\n",
        "Certification should not be used as a proxy for employability\n",
        "High certification rates across training types can mask substantial variation in labor market outcomes.\n",
